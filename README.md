[ ] Fix gameplay on ipad

[ ] The buildings still disappear when the zombies break in.

[ ] No people are spawned when the zombies breaks into the buildings on the right.

[x] The smoke does not seem to work on the chimneys.

[ ] There are no armed townspeople to fight back after zombies raid a house. 

[ ] We need  three buttons on the GUI in the lower left corner that spawns zombies in the graveyard, werewolves in a patch of forest and minotaurs from offscreen (cave?).

[ ] A new GUI "health" bar that indicates mana needed to spawn monsters.

[ ] The characters are not moving, so is there a way to get them running around and attacking one another? And maybe turn on the afraid running away animations and yellow glow so there is a lot of activity... 

[ ] And is it possible to make the knights and monsters converge on the town and start attacking one another. That would look great. 

[ ] There are flat grey rectangles sticking out of the roof of two of the houses. I am not sure what that is or if it should be deleted.

[ ] The lightening strikes the edges of the graveyard and some zombies are spawned outside the walls of the graveyard.  Can this be changed so that it all happens closer to the center of the graveyard.  And can someone tie the lightening SFX directly to the lightening strikes?

[ ] Can someone make the lights go on and off in the houses?  Maybe they are off to start, then they come on after a set elapsed time once a zombie starts to attack...  and then an armed human (or knight) comes out to kill the zombies if the house is not destroyed after a set time after the lights come on.

[ ] It would be nice to have the "Game Over" notice again.  Not sure where that went.

[ ] I turned off the "health bar" over the houses until they are working.  They are still there, but just not active right now.

[ ] Right now the houses disappear once the zombies attack.  Can this be changed to a house with the lights out instead?  Later we can replace it with a house that has broken windows and a broken door.

[ ] Anyone who can figure out how to add some of our sound effects to the various actions in the game would make a huge difference.

[ ] A new background image for the map (mad levels) would be great.  Something with some houses on it, a path, mountains, and a little castle at the end of the path to show the main goal.  James and I were able to download something from Google and replace the .png file with the new image...  it worked fairly well and revealed that it was possible.  But it was not from our game and was just a test scene, so we deleted it.  You can reference the map scene in "Royal Revolt" for ideas.

[ ] Zooming in closer is really great.  Can we take the camera in even more?  I tried it on my phone and it is still fairly small and hard to see.  Also, the camera movement was extremely fast on my iPhone.  Can someone please port the game to an android device and see how it actually plays?
